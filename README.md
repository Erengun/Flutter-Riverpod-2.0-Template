## Getting Started


### Setup

1. **Clone the template:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Erengun/Flutter-Riverpod-2.0-Template.git my_app
    cd my_app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Generate code:**
    ```bash
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

4. **Setup environment:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Authentication Module

The template includes a complete authentication system with secure credential storage and error handling.

### How it works

- **Login & Registration:** Uses Dio to POST to `/api/login` and `/api/register` endpoints.
- **Credential Caching:** Credentials are securely cached in Hive CE using AES-256 encryption, with key derived per-device.
- **State Management:** All authentication UI and logic is managed via Riverpod notifiers and state classes.
- **Error Handling:** All network and validation errors are surfaced in the UI.
- **Loading State:** UI reflects loading and error states for a smooth UX.

**Example:**
```dart
@riverpod
class LoginController extends _$LoginController {
  // ... state and logic here
  Future<LoginResponse> login({required String email, required String password}) async {
    // Handles login, error handling, caching, loading state etc.
  }
}
```

## Testing

- Integrated tests for auth controller logic (`test/features/login_controller_test.dart`)
- Run tests with:
    ```bash
    flutter test
    ```
